        <p>As Minnesotans celebrate Labor Day this holiday weekend, about 70 percent aged 16 and older either have or are seeking jobs, ranking the state highly countrywide for workforce participation.</p>
        
        <p>But another 30 percent are neither considered employed nor unemployed, and their numbers have gradually crept upward the past decade, federal data shows, and may signal future slowdowns in workforce growth.</p>
            
        <p>From 1990 to 2018, Minnesota’s labor force grew by 28 percent. But ten years forward, state economists project slowed workforce growth down to 2.4 percent by 2030.</p>

        <p>“It’s definitely a major issue for employers in the state,” said Cameron Macht, a regional analysis and outreach manager at the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, “and looking forward it may become an even bigger deal.”</p>

        <p>Some areas in Greater Minnesota have already seen significant workforce dropout rates since the recession’s end, with some equaling nearly half a county’s 16 and older population. </p>

        <p>Economic measures like unemployment and job numbers can bely growing populations of Minnesotans excluded entirely from the labor force, include retirees, enlisted military, students, homemakers, prisoners and anyone not seeking work due to disability or discouragement.</p>

        <p>More than 80 percent of Minnesota’s workforce dropouts are white with most labor growth coming from minority populations.</p>
        
        <p>Foreign-born populations also affect these rates, as they accounted for both a 60 percent jump in labor force growth from 2007 to 2017 and a 25 percent increase in those outside the workforce. </p>

        <p>Lack of sufficient child care may be pushing others to stay home, Macht said, and Census data shows about 40 percent of married couples reported at least one spouse outside the workforce.</p>

        <p>While people with criminal records face employment challenges, those still in correctional facilities are considered entirely outside the workforce, which only describes about 20,000 incarcerated Minnesotans.  Individuals in nursing homes, college dorms or the armed forces similarly don’t contribute to the labor force, though still represent small numbers.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows more people have disabilities preventing them from working.</p>

        <p>Yet, there are some encouraging trends, as fewer people are discouraged by their job prospects than the past decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, while more are seeking education, and those with associate’s degrees or higher are much more likely to be employed.</p>

        <p>"Many of the workers who are leaving our labor force won’t be coming back," Macht said, "meaning employers cannot and should not ignore anyone who wants to work but is facing barriers."</p>
