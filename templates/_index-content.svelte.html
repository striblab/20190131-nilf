        <p>Minnesota often economically outperformed other states through the Great Recession’s troubled times, and still ranks third nationally in labor force participation rates, with 70 percent aged 16 or older either working or seeking jobs.</p>
        
        <p>But that other 30 percent are neither considered employed nor unemployed, and their numbers have gradually crept upward the past decade, federal data shows, and may signal future slowdowns in workforce growth.</p>

        <p>Economic measures like unemployment and job numbers can bely growing populations of Minnesotans excluded entirely from the labor force, include retirees, enlisted military members, students, homemakers, those in correctional facilities and anyone not seeking work due to disability or discouragement.</p>
            
        <p>Some rural areas in Minnesota have already seen significant increases in workforce dropout rates since the recession’s end, with some equaling nearly half a county’s 16+ population. </p>

        <p>Sometimes these high rates can be explained by the presence of correctional facilities where prisoners are usually considered outside the workforce – but it doesn’t account for most of what’s driving these trends, since only about two percent of Minnesota's residents are currently serving sentences.</p>

        <p>"Many of the workers who are leaving our labor force won’t be coming back," said Cameron Macht, an analysist at the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, "meaning employers cannot and should not ignore anyone who wants to work but is facing barriers."</p>

        <p>A primary driver is an aging population, as retirees 65 or older comprised about half of Minnesota’s workforce dropouts in 2017, the most recent year of Census data.</p>

        <p>Foreign-born populations also affect these rates, as they accounted for both a 60 percent jump in labor force growth from 2007 to 2017 and a 25 percent increase in those outside the workforce.</p>

        <p>About 80 percent of Minnesota’s workforce dropouts are white, according to DEED, with most labor growth coming from minority populations.</p>

        <p>Additionally, lack of sufficient child care may be pushing many to stay home, Macht said, and Census data shows about 40 percent of married couples reported at least one spouse outside the workforce.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows more people have disabilities preventing them from working.</p>

        <p>Yet, there are some positive trends, as fewer people are discouraged by their job prospects than the past decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, while more are seeking education. Those with associate’s degrees or higher are much more likely to be employed.</p>

        <p>Ten years forward, DEED's projections predict slowed labor force growth of 2.4 percent by 2030, with fewer of the youngest workers and those aged 55 to 64 participating.</p>

        <p>“It’s definitely a major issue for employers in the state,” Macht said, “and looking forward it may become an even bigger deal.”</p>
