        <p>As Minnesotans celebrate Labor Day this holiday weekend, about 70 percent aged 16 and older either have or are seeking jobs, ranking the state third countrywide for workforce participation.</p>

        <p>But despite the Great Recession ending a decade ago this summer, rumbles of upcoming economic troubles could signal more difficulties ahead, as this month's economic reports show even Minnesota's low unemployment rate gradually climbing.</p>
        
        <p>Recent concerns over unemployment rates and job numbers can bely additional longstanding worries over the remaining 30 percent of Minnesotans who are considered neither employed nor unemployed, whose numbers have gradually crept upward the past decade, federal data shows, and may signal future slowdowns in workforce growth.</p>
            
        <p>From 1990 to 2018, Minnesota’s labor force grew by 28 percent, though state economists project workforce growth will slow down to 2.4 percent by 2030.</p>

        <p>“It’s definitely a major issue for employers in the state,” said Cameron Macht, a regional analysis and outreach manager at the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, “and looking forward it may become an even bigger deal.”</p>
        
        <p>If eligible workers aren't being replaced fast enough, employers may struggle more to find suitable candidates to fill open positions over the next ten years, and some regions will be hit harder than others.</p>

        <p>Areas of Greater Minnesota, for instance, have already seen significant workforce dropout rates since the recession’s end, with some equaling nearly half a county’s adult population. While many Minnesota counties have higher workforce participation than many other places nationwide, the Iron Range is replacing fewer workers more slowly, due largely to aging populations.</p>

        <p>So who are these labor force dropouts, and what's driving them from the working ranks?</p>

        <p>About half of Minnesotans outside the workforce are retirees 65 or older, though the other half is aged 16 to 64 and aren't working or seeking work for a varity of different reasons.</p>

        <p>Those others include enlisted military, students, homemakers, prisoners, the institutionalized and anyone not seeking work due to disability or discouragement.</p>

        <p>Among those staying home, lack of sufficient childcare could be of concern, Macht said, and Census data shows about a quarter of married couples with childer under 18 reported at least one spouse outside the workforce.</p>
        
        <p>More people also have disabilities, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics statistics, which may prevent jobseeking.</p>
        
        <p>Foreign-born populations also affect these rates, as they accounted for both a 60 percent jump in labor force growth from 2007 to 2017 and a 25 percent increase in those outside the workforce.</p>

        <p>Making less impact on labor force rates are those in correctional facilities, which only describes about 20,000 incarcerated Minnesotans, along with individuals in nursing homes, college dorms or the armed forces, all of whom are excluded from the numbers.</p>

        <p>Those who leave prisons with criminal records too may face difficulty and discouragement when seeking work.</p>

        <p>Yet, there are some encouraging trends, as data shows fewer people are discouraged by their job prospects than the past decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, while more are seeking education; those with associate’s degrees or higher being mores likely to find employment.</p>

        <p>"Many of the workers who are leaving our labor force won’t be coming back," Macht said, "meaning employers cannot and should not ignore anyone who wants to work but is facing barriers."</p>
