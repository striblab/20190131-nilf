Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The proportion of adults working is the number of employed, non-institutionalized, civilian adults divided by the total",,,,,,,,,,,,
"civilian population. The total civilian population (age 16-64) includes adults who are working, unemployed, and not in",,,,,,,,,,,,
the labor force. People on active duty in the United States Armed Forces are not included in this measure.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Adults are working (i.e., employed) if they did any work at all during a reference week as paid employees, worked in",,,,,,,,,,,,
"their own business or profession, worked on their own farm, or worked 15 hours or more as unpaid workers on a family",,,,,,,,,,,,
"farm or in a family business. Also included are adults who were “with a job but not at work,” including those who",,,,,,,,,,,,
"were temporarily absent from their jobs or businesses due to illness, bad weather, industrial dispute, vacation, or",,,,,,,,,,,,
other personal reasons.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Adults who are not working include individuals who were unemployed and actively seeking work, and individuals who were",,,,,,,,,,,,
"not in the labor force. Adults not in the labor force are mainly students, homemakers, retired workers, seasonal workers",,,,,,,,,,,,
"interviewed in an off season who were not looking for work, institutionalized people, and people doing only incidental",,,,,,,,,,,,
"unpaid family work or unpaid volunteer work for religious, charitable, and similar organizations.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Through 2000, data on employment status relate to one calendar week during the year (i.e., the week prior to April 1).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2006 and after, data relate to a reference week, or the calendar week preceding the date on which the respondents",,,,,,,,,,,,
completed their questionnaires or were interviewed. This week is not the same for all respondents since the interviewing,,,,,,,,,,,,
was conducted over a 12-month period.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2008, changes were made to the American Community Survey questionnaire that modified and improved the labor force",,,,,,,,,,,,
"status questions that were asked in previous years. According to the Census Bureau, these changes appear to have had the",,,,,,,,,,,,
effect of capturing an increased number of employed persons in 2008 relative to earlier years.,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The proportion of adults working will be lower than the employment rate, which is calculated by dividing the number of",,,,,,,,,,,,
employed people by the total number of people in the labor force. The labor force is made up of employed and unemployed,,,,,,,,,,,,
people who are currently looking for work. The employment rate does not account for discouraged workers no longer,,,,,,,,,,,,
"seeking employment, nor for people who do not participate in the labor force for any number of reasons.",,,,,,,,,,,,
